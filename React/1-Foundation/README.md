# React Exercises

In all of the following exercises, each solution file has a default export. It is assumed that this default export is rendered directly via a call to the `render()` method from React DOM.

Here's an illustration, supposing that `App.js` is a solution file:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.querySelector('#root')).render(<App/>);
```

Unless stated otherwise, this will be the default assumption throughout all exercise solution files.
